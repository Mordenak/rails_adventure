# Plan:

Characters have:

Class
Races
Stats
Inventory

etc.

Stats:

(Main)
STR
DEX
VIT
INT
WIS
SPD

(Sub)
Armor


Classes:

Warrior
Rogue
Wizard

etc.


Races:

Human
Elf
Dwarf

etc.

Each race and class should have it's own stat progression per level

Level cap will be set in DB - probably in a WORLD_SETTINGS table or something

Plan is to get character creation up and working with all the available options
then move onto building out the world and enemies
